Database Setup
==============

It's nice to set up your local machine with Postgres. Something like this
should roughly get you there:

    $ sudo vim /etc/postgresql/.../main/pg_hba.conf
    # set the METHOD for local connection type to 'trust':
    # local   all             all                                     trust

    # if postgres server is not already started;
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start # or similar for your distro
    # if it was already started, restart it to apply the above config change:
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart # or similar for your distro

You can choose whatever you want for the database name, database user name,
and password for that database user.

    $ sudo su postgres
    $ createuser -s <DB_USER> -P # and type your chosen password
    $ createdb <DB_NAME>
    $ exit
    # test your connection:
    $ psql -U <DB_USER> <DB_NAME>
    # if you got to a psql prompt then you're golden!
